This is a school project for [VIA University College](https://en.via.dk/).

## Main ideas

The main idea of this application is to permit to user to lend their tools.

## Description

Sometimes you may need certain types of tools, but buying them for a single use is too expensive.  
The aim of the application is to provide an interface to connect two individuals: one who rents a
machine and the other who wants to rent this machine.  
The use of geolocation to access the nearest offers and a search bar to look for the type of tool.

## Wireframe

The wireframe was done
in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/tc0sBkn9fc86Kakl155A3b/AndroidProject-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1&t=GiUK7BTmCGblK7GM-0)
, you can see some difference between the wireframe and the application it's because during
development I found some better ways to implement the UI.
